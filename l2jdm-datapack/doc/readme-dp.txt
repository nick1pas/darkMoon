This datapack is optimised for the current L2J SVN.

This readme assumes a basic understanding of MySQL and MySQL commands or familiarity with a MySQL frontend.
This readme will not teach you how to install MySQL nor will it teach you to use MySQL or any MySQL frontends.
This readme is for the sole purpose of providing a brief overview of how to either install or upgrade the data in your database.


Installation:

All users:
	Copy all content to your server dir, you know if you are doing it right if you are being asked if you want to overwrite the data folder, sellect yes to all at that stage.

For new L2J databases or existing databases where you want to delete character and account information:
	Create your loginserver and gameserver databases to match the ones in loginserver.properties and server.properties respectively (the default for both is l2jdb.)
	Method 1: Select your database and run all the batch scripts in the sql folder**
	Method 2: run database_installer.bat for windows users, or database_installer.sh for linux/unix users.

For existing L2J databases where you want to keep character and account information:
	Method 1: Select your database and run all the batch scripts in the sql folder** that correspond to tables in your database that are missing or you want to upgrade.
	Method 2: Run database_installer.bat for windows users, or database_installer.sh for linux/unix users.

IMPORTANT: 	There may also be changes to character data tables, to update these tables run the relevant batch scripts in /sql/updates/
			Files in /sql/updates/ have the following naming convention (L2J revision date and L2J revision number): YYMMDD-[REVISION].sql


**NOTE:	Read readme in the /sql/experimental/ folder.
