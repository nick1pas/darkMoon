 * the first nine (of each team) will be shown.<BR>
 * The first record in each team's array will be shown as the
 * team's leader <I>(you can't change that without changing the
 * array)</I>.<BR>
 * Sort by name always works properly.<BR>
 * If a player has more than 9 kills or deaths, it will always
 * be at the end of the list when sorting by kills or deaths.<BR>
