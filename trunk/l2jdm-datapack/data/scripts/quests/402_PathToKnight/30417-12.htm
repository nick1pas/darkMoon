Welcome, comrade of the sword. I cannot be anything but surprised - it has been long indeed since any esquires that have brought back six coins of lords. This is more than enough to prove that you have the abilities and qualities to become a Human Knight.<br>
Now it is time to complete your trial as esquire.
You have successfully endured a most demanding trial. Congratulations! Now you are qualified to become a Human Knight.<br>
I will give you the sword of ritual. This sword was used in the knighting ceremony of the legendary Sir Cedric -- bear it with care. If you take this to the Grand Master of the fighters guild, he will change your profession to a Human Knight.
