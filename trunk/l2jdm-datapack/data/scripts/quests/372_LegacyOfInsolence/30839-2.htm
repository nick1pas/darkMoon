Amazing! Please give it to me. Hmm... I knew it! Baium <br>
wasn't the last emperor of the Elmoreden empire!<br>
Although his reign was brief, Printes, Baium's son, ruled<br>
the empire. He eventually went missing somewhere in the<br>
Goddard region...<br><br>
Thank you for bringing me the book! I find it so <br>
fascinating! Here is your reward. If you find any ohter <br>
books like this, please bring them to me!
