<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Walderal:<br>
Recently, some fearless people have gone into the Tower<br>
of Insolence. They are frantically searching for ancient,<br>
secret treasure. We of the Gray Pillar Guild cannot be left<br>
out of what's going on in there. THat tower was built by<br>
dwarves! We can't allow outsiders to plunder it! We<br>
already have a team in there.<br><br>
Ah, the mysteries of the Tower... How did our noble<br>
ancestors do it? It is said that the original blueprints are<br>
located somewhere in the tower. Would you be interested<br>
in recovering them for us?<br><br>
