Manacles of a Penitent...? Ah yes. A strange item, but I can make them. Funny thing, too... I've been getting a lot of orders for these lately. They must be getting popular...<br>
I've memorized the ingredients: I'll need some steel, an Adamantite Nugget... some Silver...<br>
Be certain this is what you want. These are serious manacles and cannot be handled carelessly!
