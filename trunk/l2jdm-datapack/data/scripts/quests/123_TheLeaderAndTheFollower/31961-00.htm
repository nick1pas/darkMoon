Say, you may not have heard, but there is <font color="LEVEL">a new type of armor available but only for members of the Clan Academy</font>. Would you like to have a suit of it? I can make one for you...<br>
Oh, wait, I fear you don't meet the prerequisites. I'm sorry.<br>
(Only level 19 and higher characters who are Clan Academy members, and who have a Sponsor, are permitted to take on the quest.)
