Regretfully, I only teach Human Warriors. All Masters must teach only those of their own race. I wouldn't mind helping you if just have a personal request, but it would behoove you to find another Master.<br>
Here in this mighty capital of the kingdom of Aden, surely you will find a suitable teacher.
