Too bad! I need you to slaughter <font color="LEVEL">Queen Shyeed</font> and bring me her Talon!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">As I told you before, you don't have to kill her yourself!</font> There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Queen Shyeed and then bring her Talon to me.<br>
