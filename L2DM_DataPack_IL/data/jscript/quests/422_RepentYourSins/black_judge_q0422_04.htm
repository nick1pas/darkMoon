Very well, the testing can begin.<br>
You will go help a farmer who lost all his possessions during the war between Grecia and Aden.
He was left with less than a handful of seed!
But this tenacious farmer is bravely trying to cultivate his crops.<br>
His name is *Piotur. You will find him near the Orc Barracks in the western part of Gludio*.
Go there and help him.<br>
Come back and see us after you complete the task.
