Manacles of a Penitent...?<br>
Ah yes.<br>
A strange item, but I can make them.<br>
Funny thing, too...
I've been getting a lot of orders for these lately.
They must be getting popular...<br>
In fact, so popular that I've run out of the ingredients I need to make them!
Would you mind going and getting the ingredients listed on this recipe?
I will make the manacles for you if you do this.
