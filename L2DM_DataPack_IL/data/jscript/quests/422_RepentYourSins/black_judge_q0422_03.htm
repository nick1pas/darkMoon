Very well, the test can begin.<br>
You must go and see *Katari*, a Dark Elf.<br>
She teaches the word of Einhasad to godless heathens, such as the ol mahums...<br>
She needs your help.
Meet her at the *edge of the Dark Elven Forest north of the Marshland* and offer her your help.
Come back to see us after you complete this task.
