At last!<br>
You have come for me!<br>
Oh, pardon me...<br>
I had a very vivid dream last night, and I've been waiting for someone like you to come for me.
Just in case you were the one in my dreams, I wanted you to know.<br>
Well...
then, I may as well ask you.
I and some religious ol mahums are being threatened by *scavenger wererats*.<br>
They seem to be unaware of the teachings of the god of light.
Everyone knows, even after a conversion, ol mahums are not to be trifled with.
The same can be said of the Dark Elves.
Our god of light is no coward, and I'm ready to teach them a thing or two.<br>
Please, would you go kill these creatures?<br>
Bring back 10 *skulls of scavenger wererats*.<br>
They can be found in the *Neutral Zone*.<br>
Put a good scare into them, something to let them know they shouldn't pick on missionaries.
