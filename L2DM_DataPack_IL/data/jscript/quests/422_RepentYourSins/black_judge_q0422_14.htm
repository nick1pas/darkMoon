Your sins have been absolved and you are free to go your separate ways.
The *Sin Eater* will return from whence he came.
There, his sin is changed to virtue, and virtue to nothing.<br>
*(Note: If you click the link below, the manacle of penitent disappears. At this time, all the items contained 
in the inventory of the Sin Eater disappears as well, so please check if you put any items in the inventory.)<br>
