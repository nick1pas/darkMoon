I'll make an even exchange of weapons with you. For example, I will exchange a Mithrill Dagger for a two-handed Claymore of the same level. However, there are a couple of things you should know.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Special Abilities</font> don't transfer<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Enchantments</font> do transfer with exchange<br>
