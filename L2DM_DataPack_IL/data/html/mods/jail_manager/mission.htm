Good! <font color="LEVEL">%playername%</font> as i said to leave jail you'll have to take a mission. So, the mission is to collect <font color="LEVEL">jail points</font>.<br>
To collect <font color="LEVEL">jail points</font> you need to kill the monsters arround you!<br>
Per every kill you will receive a <font color="LEVEL">jail point</font>. Hum.... lemme see you will have to get <font color="LEVEL">%amount%</font> points.<br>
Come back when you're done with my mission and i will teleport you out from this horror place!<br><br>
