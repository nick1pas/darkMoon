A manor refers to any property owned by the lord. Anything produced within its confines remains the exclusive property of the lord.
<br>
You are to be an agricultural producer. First you must buy a <font color="LEVEL">seed</font> and place it onto a monster. This is easily accomplished while targeting.
<br>
When the monster dies you will harvest a crop from its body. To harvest a <font color="LEVEL">crop</font> you will target the corpse onto which a seed was sown and use the harvester. If you need one, I'll be happy to sell you a harvester.
<br>
These crops are the major product of the manor. After you have harvested, bring the crop to me. I will appraise it and give you an appropriate <a action= "bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 2">reward</a> for it! If you want to know what the <a action= "bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 2">reward</a> will be, I will tell you about it later...
