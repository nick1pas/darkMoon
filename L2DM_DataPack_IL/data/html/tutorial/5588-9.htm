When a character of level 5 or above dies, some of its experience score (Exp) will be reduced and sometimes, with the exception of the weapons the character is currently equipped with, other items can be dropped. This is not true of characters of level 4 or below who have never killed another character.<br>
Also, if a character whose status value is 0 (You can look up the values in the Status Window, Alt+T) or if a character who has killed other characters less than five times, dies while fighting against another character (PvP), he/she will not drop any items.<br>
Since players are not allowed to "force attack" in order to kill another character in the PG-15 server, this option is not included.<br>
