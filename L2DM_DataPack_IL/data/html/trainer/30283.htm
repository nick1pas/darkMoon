Blacksmith Allman:
<br>
My family has been blacksmithing here for five generations. My dream is to make a famous sword that will live forever in song and legend. When I was young, I traveled all over the continent to gather materials. I cannot make it yet because I'm still short a few key things. If only I could fulfill my dream before I die...
