Blacksmith of Mammon:
<br>
Ah, yes, the seal of gnosis! May you recive the blessings of Mammon!
You have come far to find me. I can provide you with the highest-quality weapons and armor.
<br>
Blacksmiths the world over try to copy my refind techniques, but theirs' pale in comparison to mine.
<br>
I must ask you but one thing. As a dwarf of Mammon, I cannot accept money from the outside world.
I only accept payment in <font color="LEVEL">ancient adena</font>.
