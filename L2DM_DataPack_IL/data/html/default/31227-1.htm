<font color="LEVEL">1: Heavy - Medals and Prizes</font><br>
Hunting the monsters that dwell outside the village will yield medals. Bring them to me and I'll reward you with a fabulous prize, personally selected for you by Collector Bashtal! You'll find two types of medals: Regular medals and Heavy - medals. Heavy - medals are quite rare, and therefore most valuable, especially for your future.<br>
