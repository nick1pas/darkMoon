Every mod added should provide a list of commands and expected parameters. We provide this ingame configuration service as an extra bonus but we can't guarantee a given mod will behave as expected by its authors as core suffer changes.<br>
Your best bet would be to carefully read provided help, and try these settings on your own before organizing/announcing events around these mods.<br>
If you find any error, please feel free to report it at http://forum.l2jserver.com. Hopefully the L2J crew or the mod author/maitainer will be able to provide further assistance.
