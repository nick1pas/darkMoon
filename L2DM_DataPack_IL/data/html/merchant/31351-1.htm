The Primeal Isle, you say... I'm afraid that i don't really<br1>
know much about it. I do know that it was discovered by a<br1>
man named Marquez, and that very few people manage<br1>
to reach ot because of its remoteness and the limited<br1>
means of transportation.<br1>
<br>
I have also heard that Rune is concocting plans to<br1>
develop the Primeval Isle, which is why it built a wharf<br1>
there and even set up a ferry service<br1>
<br>
But since the Primeval Isle isn't well known and it is said<br1>
that there are many dangerous dinosaurs that roam its<br1>
jungles,very few passengers choose to embark on the<br1>
ferry. Ah, but with so many curious adventurers heading<br1>
to these parts these day's I'm sure that ferry will soon<br1>
have more passengers than ot can carry! If you're<br1>
interested in taking the trip, the ferry of the Primeval Isle<br1>
leaves about 3 or 4 time every hour; buy a ticket for it<br1>
just like you would for any other ferry. Interested? Well,<br1>
take some time and think about it, eh !?<br1>
